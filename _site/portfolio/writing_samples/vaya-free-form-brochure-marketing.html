Vaya Free Form is positioned as a high-end alternative to tape light. This is written for a few related audiences. The primary audiences are building owners, architects, and lighting designers.

<h2 id="spread-1">Enhance your building. Define your brand.</h2>
<p class="ck-overview">Innovative lighting lets you completely transform an environment, from calming or energizing a retail store with ambient light, to accenting architectural features on a building exterior. Meet VAYA Free Form—a slim, flexible linear LED luminaire that lights even the tightest of coves or recesses, straight or curved, in any setting. VAYA Free Form delivers the quality and reliability you’ve come to expect from Philips VAYA. And it creates new opportunities for lighting designers, architects, building owners, and others.</p>

<p>At VAYA, we bring high-quality, affordable exterior and interior LED lighting solutions to customers and sites throughout the world. Our full family of popular luminaires includes a wide range of choices, from flood lighting to direct-view lighting. No matter what VAYA luminaire you choose, you get great lighting and proven reliability. All at a price that fits your budget.</p>

<p>We designed Free Form with flexibility in mind—literally. This compact, bendable LED luminaire fits almost anywhere, making it the right choice for a remarkably broad range of applications. Indoor or outdoor. Straight runs or curved runs. Mounted in a cove or in a recess. Highlighting a water fountain or illuminating a walkway—there’s no limit to what you can do with Free Form.</p>

<p>Lighting designers need high quality illumination. Architects need flexibility. Building owners and managers need durability, reliability, and efficiency. VAYA Free Form meets all these needs and more.</p>

<h4>VAYA Free Form sets the mood</h4>
<p>Energize your retail or office setting with cool light. Or let your guests socialize in a calm and comfortable environment with warm light. With color temperatures ranging from a relaxing 2200 K to an invigorating 6000 K, VAYA Free Form lets you create the right mood.</p>

<h4>VAYA Free Form sets you apart</h4>
<p>Lighting is essential to any architectural or landscape design. It’s a subtle—but crucial—detail that affects how people experience your building and your brand. VAYA Free Form helps you establish your visual identity and keep it consistent, even across several locations.</p>

<h2 id="spread-2">Solving the Sticky Problems Posed by Tape Light</h2>
<p>When considering lighting for your construction or renovation project, it’s hard to ignore the low upfront costs of tape light. But over time, the price of maintenance and replacement can be significant. </p>

<p>VAYA Free Form isn’t tape light. It’s a high quality, flexible luminaire. And when you compare it to conventional tape light, it’s obvious that Free Form is the right choice for your project.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the reasons why.</p>

<h4>LED Protection and Optics</h4>
<p>Some tape lights offer no protection of the LEDs, leaving sensitive circuitry vulnerable to damage and failure. Other tape lights protect the LEDs with silicone sleeves. But LEDs often are not secured inside these silicone sleeves, making it difficult to mount and aim the light. Many silicone lenses give hazy light, which results in uneven illumination and visible color shift over the light beam.</p>

<p>VAYA Free Form LEDs are protected by a tough silicone exterior, and the LEDs and internal circuitry are held in place beneath the frosted silicone lens. The result? Uniform illumination across the length of the luminaire.</p>

<h4>Mounting Options</h4>
<p>Frequently, tape lights are mounted with double-sided adhesive. Surfaces need to be impossibly clean for these adhesives to hold, which means extra preparation time for installation. Surfaces also need to be smooth, further limiting your mounting options. And over time, heat and humidity take their toll, causing the adhesives fail. So you’ll also need to reinstall the lights several times during their lifespan.</p>

<p>VAYA Free Form offers reliable mounting options for virtually any surface. The easy-to-install mounting track and mounting clips hold Free Form in place in straight or curved runs.</p>

<h4>Cutting and Connecting Light Segments</h4>
<p>Some tape lights can be reconnected after they’re cut, but these connectors can be unreliable and difficult to install. Other tape lights can’t be reconnected at all—so if you cut a segment, everything from the cut to the end of the reel becomes waste. And if a section of tape light fails, you’ll need to replace the entire strip.</p>

<p>VAYA Free Form push-and-click connectors are secure, reliable, and easy to install. Individual segments can be replaced and connected, so you’ll save money in the long run by using only what you need.</p>

<h4>Quality without Compromises</h4>
<p>Free your brand from the constraints of tape light. Free Form is cost-effective to buy, install, power, and maintain. Over time, Free Form saves you money, without sacrificing quality. And because Free Form is made by Philips VAYA, you know that you’re investing in a reliable luminaire. Your brand deserves nothing less.</p>

<h2 id="spread-3">What Makes VAYA Free Form Right For You?</h2>

<p>Choosing an LED lighting solution is an important aesthetic decision, since lighting has a big impact on the look of your building, now and for years to come. It’s also an important financial decision, since you need to find a right-sized solution that meets your specific needs and budget. And finally, consider the technical impact. Any lighting solution you choose needs to fit seamlessly into your building, and integrate smoothly with lighting controls and other key solution elements. With VAYA Free Form, the choice is simple. Here’s why.</p>

<p>We designed VAYA Free Form to keep all elements of LED lighting simple, cost-effective, and reliable. You get:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dependability</b> – A tough silicone enclosure protects the LEDs in indoor and outdoor environments. Mounting options ensure exact positioning of Free Form on any surface, so your luminaires stay in place—delivering accurate, efficient light.</li>

<li><b>Light, Anywhere</b> – With its low profile, Free Form fits into the tightest of spaces. And thanks to mounting options for virtually any surface, Free Form can illuminate any cove or recess, highlight any feature, and conform to any shape.</li>

<li><b>Uniform Illumination</b> – The first thing you’ll notice when you turn on VAYA Free Form is… nothing. No striation. No color shift. No visible difference between Free Form luminaires. Just even, uniform light.</li>

<li><b>Cost-Effective</b> – In interior environments, Free Form segments can be cut and connected, no soldering required. So you lower your costs by reducing waste and lessening environmental impact. Win-win.</li>

<li><b>Simple Installation</b> – Use mounting tracks for precise, straight runs, or use secure mounting clips for curves and bends. The carefully designed silicone enclosure protects the internal circuitry and keeps everything firmly in place. So the LEDs won’t get damaged or change position when installing Free Form.</li>

<li><b>Color Temperature Choices</b> – Free Form is available in six different color temperatures, from warm 2200 K, to cool 6000 K. So you get the right light for your project.</li>

<li><b>Global Reach</b> – VAYA brings exceptional (and cost-effective) lighting solutions to large-scale implementations, such as hundreds of retail stores, maintaining brand consistency between sites and across borders.</li>

<li><b>A Clear Vision of the Future</b> – VAYA is driven by, and responsive to, the evolving needs of the marketplace, adding new capabilities and innovations to VAYA Free Form and the rest of our extensive portfolio of lighting solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These reasons and more make VAYA Free Form the right choice for a diverse range of projects and a wide range of buildings. But behind all these advantages, there’s one that stands out—VAYA Free Form gives you the right lighting, at the right price. That’s why so many buildings around the world are lit with VAYA. </p>

<h2 id="spread-4">Free Form and Function: A Closer Look</h2>
    <p><em>Each bullet point is a callout on a photo of Free Form.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Watertight</b>. An overmolded integrated leader cable keeps the luminaire protected in outdoor installations.</li>
    <li><b>Versatile Control</b>. Free Form accepts 0-10 V, DALI, DMX, or DyNet control signals in conjunction with the right Philips Lighting or third party converter.</li>
    <li><b>Color Temperature Choices</b>. Options from warm 2200 K to cool 6000 K let you choose the right color temperatures for your project.</li>
    <li><b>Long Runs</b>. Up to 10 m (33 ft) of Free Form are supported in a single run. Power cables can be up to 8 m (26.3 ft), including the leader cable and all jumper connections.</li>
    <li><b>Durable Silicone Lens and Enclosure</b>. The frosted 120° lens and opaque enclosure protect the LEDs and internal circuitry.</li>
    <li><b>Cuttable</b>. Free Form is field cuttable in 62.5 mm (2.5 in) increments, so you use only what you need.</li>
    <li><b>Easy Connection</b>. Make simple push-and-click connections to a leader cable or between Free Form segments. Use two leader cable connectors to create custom jumper cables for gap-free illumination of tight corners.</li>
    <li><b>Secure Mounting</b>. Mount Free Form along curves or in straight runs using the mounting clips or mounting track. The luminaire stays in place, without any shifting.</li>
</ul>

    <h2 id="spread-5">Showcase</h2>
<h4>Example 1: Keeping people safe on indoor or outdoor stairways</h4>
<p>Placed underneath a banister or in a recess running alongside a staircase, use Free Form to ensure people’s safety in low light settings. Conceal power supplies and cabling in an appropriate enclosure underneath the staircase. Free Form can light both indoor and outdoor staircases.</p>

<h4>Example 2: Lighting a curved ceiling cove</h4>
<p>Light the entire length of a curved cove with Free Form and mounting with polycarbonate clips. You can energize any environment with a crisp white, such as the shopping mall pictured below.</p>

<h4>Example 3: Creating a relaxed atmosphere in a hotel restaurant</h4>
<p>To create an inviting setting in a hotel bar and restaurant, Free Form is an ideal choice. Consider using 2200 K Free Form on the underside of a bar, and in coves above and behind the bar. This creates a soft, warm glow around the bar, and encourages your guests to relax and stay a while.</p>

<p><em>[Sample image]</em></p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Product</th>
        <th>Color Temperature</th>
        <th>Lumens</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Free Form, Dimmable White</td>
        <td>2200 K</td>
        <td><em>xx</em> fc</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Example 4: Inviting visitors for a nighttime stroll in an outdoor garden</h4>
<p>Use Free Form to illuminate the boundaries of a walkway and ensure visitors’ safety, while minimizing overhead light at night. Cooler color temperatures, such as 4000 K, enhance the green coloring of plants. Warmer color temperatures, such as 3000 K, can bring out the earthy tones of brick and stone. Mount Free Form underneath capstone overhangs to graze low stone walls.</p>
