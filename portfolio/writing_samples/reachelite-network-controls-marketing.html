<h2>Capturing Imagination and Attention</h2>
<p>Imagine if your building façade could show tomorrow’s weather forecast. Or if a trail of lights could follow visitors as they walk through your breezeway. Or if your famous landmark could change color every time someone mentions it on social media. When you pair the right control devices with your Philips Color Kinetics luminaires, your lights become more than just a spectacle. They react to their environment and capture people’s imagination—and attention.</p>

<p>To unlock the full potential of your lighting installation, you need more than just award-winning LED luminaires. You need the right combination of input devices and lighting design software. And when you bring it all together with the right control solution, your lights can really shine.</p>

<p>When it comes to controlling your luminaires, we offer the flexibility of using the industry-standard DMX protocol or our proprietary KiNET protocol for Ethernet networks.</p>

<h4>Utility</h4>
<p>DMX offers a cost-effective, industry standard approach to controlling your luminaires in universes of up to 512 addresses. That’s up to 170 uniquely controllable three-channel nodes per universe, making DMX ideal for smaller installations, or configurations where many luminaires will operate in unison.</p>

<p>If you already have your own DMX controller and infrastructure in place, we can work with that. If you want to buy a third party DMX controller and use our luminaires and power/data supplies, not a problem. DMX is powerful because it’s ubiquitous. So if DMX is your choice and you want to take advantage of that, we’re behind you.</p>

<h4>Scalability</h4>
<p>DMX has some limitations. Accommodating more universes than your controller supports frequently means additional hardware. When you’re talking about tens of thousands of nodes, the costs can add up very quickly. That’s where KiNET comes in.</p>

<p>KiNET is the scalable Ethernet lighting protocol from Philips Color Kinetics. Because it isn’t subject to DMX addressing limitations, KiNET is more suitable for intricate, color-changing light shows and video displays, both of which require large numbers of unique addresses.</p>

<p>KiNET features two-way communication and works with standard Ethernet networking hardware, such as switches. KiNET installations can also take advantage of ActiveSite from Philips Color Kinetics.</p>

<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>ActiveSite integrates connected luminaires, digital lighting controls, and sophisticated lighting management software. Connected luminaires share data about their status and operations with ActiveSite lighting management software running in the cloud. With ActiveSite, you can remotely monitor, manage, and maintain each connected luminaire from anywhere in the world, at any time.</p>

<h4>Expandability</h4>
<p>Integrating third party sensors or apps into your lighting system opens up all sorts of options for interactivity and control beyond pre-created light shows and effects. Specialized controllers and protocol converters expand your system’s capability beyond KiNET and DMX control, allowing your lights to respond to commands from a wide range of possible protocols—serial, Ethernet, DALI, DyNet, and more.</p>

<p>Whatever your vision, there’s a way to make it a reality.</p>
